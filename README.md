London Tube
Given a list of London Tube stations and lines, write an application to answer the following question:  What stations have a minimum N stops from East Ham?  Print the results in alphabetical order.
For example, if N = 4, the results would be:
         Abbey Road (lines = District, DLR)
         Bromley-by-Bow (lines = District)
         Canning Town (lines = District, Jubilee)
         Dagenham Heathway (lines = District)
         Leytonstone High Road (lines = District, Overground)
         Star Lane (lines = District, DLR)
         Stratford (lines = District, Jubilee)

I do not print the tube lines for the output.  However; this is a future enhancement.
